# MyStringImplementation

## Overview

`MyString` is a minimalistic implementation of a dynamic string class in C++. This project was created as a test assignment for a company and demonstrates fundamental concepts of dynamic memory management, copy control, and operator overloading in C++.

## Features

- Dynamic memory management
- Copy constructor, move constructor, and destructor
- Assignment operators (copy, move, and from C-string)
- Concatenation operators (`+=` and `+`)
- Output stream operator (`<<`)
- Comparison operator (`<`)

## Usage Example

For a usage example, see the provided `main.cpp` file.

## Limitations

This implementation is intentionally kept simple and lacks many features found in a fully-fledged string class such as `std::string`. Below are some areas where `MyString` can be further improved:

- **Exception Safety:** Currently, the implementation doesn't fully handle exceptions.
- **Efficiency:** Some operations can be optimized for better performance.
- **Additional Features:** Support for more operators and methods like `find`, `substr`, `insert`, `erase`, etc., can be added.
- **Unicode Support:** This implementation handles only basic ASCII characters and doesn't support Unicode.
- **Multithreading and Optimization:** The current implementation lacks support for multithreading and additional optimizations.

## Future Work

- Implement more string manipulation methods.
- Improve memory management for better performance and safety.
- Add support for Unicode.
- Implement support for multithreading.
- Optimize existing methods.
- Write comprehensive tests for all functionalities.
